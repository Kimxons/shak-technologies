# Core Banking Experience (Static Prototype)

This repository contains a framework-free HTML/JavaScript/Bootstrap prototype that mirrors the multi-module experience of the larger core banking solution. The goal is to iterate quickly on UX flows (login, common dashboard, customer management, etc.) without spinning up Angular.

### Roadmap
- Add additional module folders under `public/modules/` as new workstreams (loans, treasury, etc.).
- Keep shared behaviours inside `assets/js/app.js` (or split into multiple files as complexity grows).
- Use Bootstrap 5 components plus the lightweight custom styles to stay close to enterprise design guidelines.

### Architectural notes (work in progress)
- `assets/js/services/clientService.js` will encapsulate all HTTP calls used by the Angular `EmployeeService`, exposing a familiar API (`getClient`, `searchClients`, `createClient`, `updateClient`, etc.).
- `assets/js/models/clientFormModel.js` will handle schema defaults, validation helpers, derived computed fields, and transformations required before sending data downstream.
- `assets/js/services/lookupService.js` + `assets/js/ui/lookupField.js` hydrate dropdowns with the same static + remote data Angular relied on (client types, countries, resident statuses, relationship managers, etc.).
- Feature pages import these modules to keep view logic thin, making it easier to plug in additional modules later.

### Running locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The `dev` script serves the `public/` directory via [tools/static-server.js](tools/static-server.js).

If you’re calling OldAPI endpoints (e.g. posting to `/api/OldAPI`), you must configure the proxy target:

- PowerShell:
    - ` $env:PROXY_OLDAPI = "http://HOST:PORT"; npm run dev`
- Or via CLI flag:
    - `npm run dev -- --proxy-oldapi http://HOST:PORT`

Without `PROXY_OLDAPI`/`--proxy-oldapi`, the dev server will return:
`OldAPI proxy target not configured...`

You can also open the HTML files directly in a browser if CDN access is available, but same-origin `/api/OldAPI` calls will not work without a proxy.
